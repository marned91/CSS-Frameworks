# Purpose
The purpose of this assignment was to apply Tailwind CSS to the JavaScript 2 course project in order to demonstrate skills in using a CSS framework for building responsive, accessible, and user-friendly interfaces. The focus was on improving design consistency, enhancing user experience, and ensuring the application works across different screen sizes.
# Description
This project is a continuation of the JavaScript 2 course assignment, styled with Tailwind CSS. The original functionality of the social media application remains the same, but the visual presentation and user experience have been improved through framework integration.
